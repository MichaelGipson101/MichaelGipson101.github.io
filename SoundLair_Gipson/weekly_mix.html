<p>Did you know that music has the ability to help plants grow? As farfetched as that may sound, a study in 2007 confirmed that this was true! Researchers in South Korea, led by Mi-Jeong Jeong of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology, discovered that sounds at both 125hz and 250hz contributed to the production of certain genes in the plants that let them grow faster!
